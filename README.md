# Veterinary Medicine Web Application

**Authors:** Timothy Mok, Aron Saengchan, and Jimmy Zhu

## Summary
In collaboration with the Veterinary School of Medicine at the University of Calgary, the objective of this project was to create a full stack web application to use in the daily operations of their clinic. It serves to address three important areas - user management, animal management, and treatment process. This application is intended to be primarily used by administrators and staff that service the animals. As such, an interface that meets the requirements of being both functional and user-friendly was developed.

The frontend of the web application was developed using JavaScript along with the React framework. The Bootstrap CSS framework was used for styling and Axios was employed to properly make http requests from the browser. In the backend, Java was used with the Spring framework to create API endpoints in order to obtain data from the MySQL database. User authentication and authorization was implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

*This project was completed as part of ENSF 607: Advanced Software Design and Architecture and ENSF 608: Databases at the University of Calgary.*
